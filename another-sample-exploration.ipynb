However, it is useful for building confidence in the pattern and searching for an easy contradiction. Our professor recommended testing excursum out to ten trillion, which would run into two barriers: limitations of machine precision and difficulty (in terms of computer time). Brother Neff casually mentioned that some students claimed that it would take thirty days in the Linux Lab. I wondered if, with a little ingenuity, I might be able to do a little better. Overcoming the first barrier proved easy: the ```quad_float``` type in the NTL library provides enough precision for this specific case.

One of my first questions after discovering a pattern among the numbers Brother Neff had given us was why those two numbers were &ldquo;special.&rdquo; I wondered if there might be more that have the same or similar properties. In fact, Rayleigh's theorem states that for every irrational number greater than 1, there is a complementary irrational number given by $s = r/(r - 1)$ where $r$ and $s$ partition the positive integers in a Beatty sequence. My code is able to test any pair of numbers as well as generate a Beatty &ldquo;partner&rdquo; to test this theorem.

Bob (person 1) can use the irrational number to generate a Beatty sequence used to offset each ASCII character much like a shift cipher (using mod to handle wrap-around). A second Beatty sequence derived from the first could perform a second pass on the data. The receiving person Alice can then apply the Beatty sequences in the opposite order to decrypt the message. This technique would be much stronger than a simple shift-cipher and is fairly easy to generate.

Instead of shuffling an entire song list and persisting it between application sessions, you could simply generate a random irrational number and an index. The first Beatty sequence would play the songs in non-consecutive order, and switching to the other Beatty sequence at the appropriate time will ensure that the rest of the songs are played. With a clever use of a modulus, you could start the index at any song in the list. This would provide a pseudo-random feel for the song order while minimizing memory and disk footprint.\n"
