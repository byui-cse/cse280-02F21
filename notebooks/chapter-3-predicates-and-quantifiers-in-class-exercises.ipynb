    "A function is presented, which takes a list and returns one of two different functions, each with the same codomain, depending on if a certain function returns true for some element of the input. The exercise is to unscramble a secret message in a list of lists by first transforming the data, then mapping the data through the respective results of the presented function. This idea may sound very hard, but it won't be too difficult if the function required to transform the data is as simple as ```x->map(y->y%2,x)```.\n",

    "#### Design\n",
    "* Data is passed through a series of transformations.\n",
    "* To encrypt, start with a letter and a poem.\n",
    "* Find any index of that letter in the poem. (This step may need human supervision.)\n",
    "* Translate that index in a pre-determined base.\n",
    "* Turn the result into a list of numbers less than the radix (call this transform alpha).\n",
    "* Add a random number times the radix to each element of the list (call this transform beta).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the first pull is selected, all the numbers in the result list must meet a certain condition. If the second pull is selected, at least one number in the result list must not meet that condition. One way to come up with the condition is to pick a certain number $p$ coprime to the radix, and say that $p$ must divide all the numbers in a given list from the first pull. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decrypting\n",
    "* Take the encrypted message:\n",
    "* transform it: (lambda x:x%8);\n",
    "* get the decrypt function; and\n",
    "* run the transformed data through the decrypt function.\n",
