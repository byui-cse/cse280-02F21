In general, a backward slash precedes special symbols or commands in LaTeX. If we want another Greek letter, like $\\theta$, we use `\\theta`. Now, also note that I used \"`\\mathrm{e}`\" for the base of the natural logarithm.  This signaled to LaTeX that I wanted the character written in Roman font, and not italics, so I used `\\mathrm`.
