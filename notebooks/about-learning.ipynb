    "> To handle problems requiring data beyond the capacity of students and educators impatient to shine, the ancient Sophists devised certain very effective discussion techniques. In these, the most important skill was that of presenting evidence by implication or inference only. Since it is quite impossible in a public discourse (or in print, for that matter) to put all one&rsquo;s evidence on display, one must be allowed on occasion to present one&rsquo;s knowledge merely by inference. The Sophists seized upon this welcome path of escape from drudgery, and by the arts of rhetoric made of it a broad highway to successful teaching careers. A limited use of jargon is indispensable in any field: having solved for &ldquo;x&rdquo;, we do not have to derive &ldquo;x&rdquo; every time it is mentioned, but simply to indicate it by a symbol, such as those useful keywords commonly used to power historical discussions: The Medieval Mind, Sturm und Drang, the Frontier, Hellenism, the Enlightenment, Puritanism, the Primitive, Relativity, etc., each of which is supposed to set a whole chorus of bells chiming in our heads&#x2014;the echoes of deep and thorough reading. But by a more familiar process these labels are no mere labels anymore; they have become the whole substance of our knowledge. The student today has never solved for that &ldquo;x&rdquo; about which he talks so glibly&#x2014;he has got its value from an answerbook; the cue word is not just a cue; it is now the whole play.\n",

Yet we all tend to resist new knowledge, content in the truth that what we already know is all we really need to know to get by. Gaining greater knowledge, then, requires us to fight this tendency to live to get by. But when getting by seems good enough, how does one develop the desire to learn to change?\n",

To admit that one is ignorant in this regard is not to confess that one doesn&rsquo;t understand. Rather it is to confess that one chooses not to understand.\n",
