    "My main piece of advice for this topic, and frankly most of the topics in Discrete Math, is to make sure that you &ldquo;get your hands dirty.&rdquo; The book does a good job of introducing the definitions of terms, and gives enough examples that you should be able to figure out what it is being taught through a careful reading or two of the material. Nonetheless, your understanding will not be anywhere near complete until you have gone through the exercises and problems for the week, making sure to both reach, and more importantly understand, a solution for each of them. If the solution does not come quickly to you --- by which I mean not within five or ten minutes --- that is a good thing, and means that you should press onward! Since taking Discrete Math 1 I have regularly run across situations in higher level courses in which a solution to a problem was not immediately obvious to me. Often the solution came down to making a connection I had previously missed, which is a large component of this section. As far as advice on the topic of actually making connections, I highly suggest that you get yourselves comfortable with sets and set representation in Python or your programming language of choice. Helper functions can save you hours of work on the homework, but only if you know how to code them in such a way as to not only be correct, but to also provide meaningful output from an intuitive input.\n"

I would have understood the next sentence stating that ordered pairs, one taken from set $X$ and one taken from set $Y$, are related ($xRy$), and that their relationship would then have made much more sense when talking about binary relations and their definitions. I should have asked questions more even if I don’t understand or make sense of the questions I thought of.\n"

Taking the abstract and applying it to applications that can be observed rather than read can be a difficult task, but luckily the internet is a medium that exists. Using simple searches, we can gain visual representations of complex or confusing concepts. Though fairly simple in concept, I found it somewhat difficult to visualize the differences just from the reading.\n"
