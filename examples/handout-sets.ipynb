This notation is useful when the number of elements in a set is small. For example, the set consisting of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be defined using roster notation as:\n","\n","$A = \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$\n","\n","\n","**Set builder** notation is a way to define a set based on some condition or rule. \n","\n","The format for set builder notation is $A = \\{ x \\in S:\\, P(x) \\}$, where $x$ is a variable representing elements of the set $A$ being defined, $S$ is a larger set from which elements of $A$ can be taken, and $P(x)$ is a condition or **predicate** that determines whether $x$ is an element of the set. For example, the set of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be defined using set builder notation as:\n","\n","$A = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Z} :\\, x \\textrm{ is odd and } 0 < x < 10  \\}$\n","\n","\n","Recall that a **predicate** is a logical statement whose truth value is a function of one or more variables. In the above statement, the predicate is \"$x \\textrm{ is odd and } 0 < x < 10$\". This predicate is a condition or *truth value* that depends on the variable $x$."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Set Comprehensions in Python\n","\n","Just like mathematical sets can be constructed using roster notation or set builder notation, Python offers two methods for constructing lists, sets, and dictionaries.

The container elements can be generated using a *comprehension*.

Both are patterned after the mathematical set builder notation. \n","\n","The comprehension syntax is `{ expression for variable in iterable if condition }`, where `expression` is the final value of each element in the set, `for variable in iterable` describes a sequence from which elements of the new container will be taken, and `condition` is an optional **predicate** that determines whether the element is included in the set. \n","\n","For example, the set of all odd integers between 0 and 10 can be defined using a set comprehension in Python as:\n","\n","`A = { x for x in range(1, 10) if x % 2 }`\n","\n","In this expression, `x` is a varable representing elements of the set $A$ being defined, `for x in range(1, 10)` is \"larger set\" from which each `x` is taken, and `if x % 2` is the condition or predicate that detemines whether each `x` is an element of the set being defined. \n","\n","The set of the first twenty even numbers could be represented using set builder notation as:\n","\n","$S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Z} :\\, x \\textrm{ is even and } 0 \\le x < 20  \\}$\n","\n","This set could be created in Python like this:\n","\n","`S = {x for x in range(0, 20) if x % 2 == 0}`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Try it: {display-mode: \"form\"}\n","S = {x for x in range(0, 20) if x % 2 == 0}\n","print(S)"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Another way to represent this same set of the first twenty even numbers would be:\n","\n","$S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x = 2n \\textrm{ and } 0 \\le n < 20 \\}$\n","\n","In Python, this would be:\n","\n","`S = {2*n for n in range(0, 20)}`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title Try it: {display-mode: \"form\"}\n","S = {2*n for n in range(0, 20)}\n","print(S)"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Note that in Python, the larger set $\\mathbb{Z}$ is implied by the use of the `range()` function, which only generates integers."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Nested loops\n","Python comprehensions can have one or more `for` clauses and zero or more `if` clauses.
