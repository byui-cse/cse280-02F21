        "**Roster notation** defines a set by listing all the elements of the set inside curly braces and separated by commas. This notation is useful when the number of elements in a set is small. For example, the set consisting of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be defined using roster notation as:\n",

For example, the set of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be defined using set builder notation as:\n",
